# esp32-scoring-device
esp32 based scoring device for fencing.
Visit the Wiki for more details what it does, and how to build it yourself.
This project has 3 repositories:
* This one, which contains the wiki and the esp32 code
* [One with the Android Studio code for the remote control app ](https://github.com/pietwauters/remotecontrolapp)
* [One with the KiCad files for the pcb design](https://github.com/pietwauters/esp32_scoring_device_hardware)

3D printing files for an enclosure can be found here: https://www.printables.com/model/1138815-enclosure-for-scoring-device

However, a transparent plastic box and some plywood is also a good starting point if you don't own a 3D-printer or if you just want to make a demonstrator.
